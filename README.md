# FinanceManager
Simple python based application. Interfaces with SQL database using SQLite.

The app will take in data and store it in an SQL server. 
It will then display the different expenditures, as well as spending by category.

Next steps:
1) Add a GUI using the tkinter module
2) Add a way to import data through a more user friendly method like Google Forms
